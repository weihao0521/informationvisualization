            <p>U.S Presidential Campaign in United State is running every 4 years, and 2016 Presidential Campaign became heat since both party has reached the end of debating and processed to nominate the president candidate within their party. In this project, we demonstrate a systematic way to track a candidate’s status during campaign and compare the differences between two candidates. Our data source is based on different media/organization’s poll, candidate’s super PAC report and reports or journals frommainstream media. And three different modules are implemented in our system.</p>
