Bernie Sanders from other presidential candidates is the fact that he's a self-identified democratic socialist and represents his state as an independent, not a Republican or Democrat (though he caucuses with the Democrats).

Trump	Trump, born in 1946, is a billionaire real estate developer, businessman and television personality. After decades of persistent flirtation with the idea of seeking a White House bid, Trump announced on June 16, 2015, that he would officially seek the GOP nomination. Having never previously held office, Trump will likely tout his success in business as the focal point of his presidential platform. But he is no stranger to Washington. Trump has been a frequent donor to both Democratic and Republican federal political candidates, spending tens of thousands of dollars supporting them and causing some to question his sincerity as a GOP candidate. He also sparked controversy by questioning whether President Barack Obama is a U.S. citizen, asking for his birth certificate and passport history. Candidacy declared: June 16, 2015
